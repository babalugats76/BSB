                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>Started in 1993, the Backstreet Boys quickly rose to fame, from a small group of Orlando youngsters who could sing and dance, to a team of musical superstars with eight albums, two movies, eleven world tours, and countless awards between them.</p>
                    <p>As the years passed, the group has been responsive to the changing demands of their adoring audiences.  Evolving styles have taken the BSB fromm R&B and club to hip-hop and pop.  In their more recent work, the group's maturity is becoming evident in their abandonment of synthesizers in favor of live instruments.  As do many things, however, they have recently come full-circle and are embracing again the dance-beat energy with a distinctly electropop feel.</p>
                    <p>Over the years, the "boys" have come to be great businessmen.  After years of fighting their original manager, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lou_Pearlman" target="_blank">Lou Pearlman</a>, who took advantage of their youth and business naivete, they now work in partnership with a number of large corporations: recently, both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jok1adXq2G8" target="_blank">Old Navy</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72ikjnNbQSA" target="_blank">Burger King</a> have benefitted from this group's larger than life presence in popular - and commercial - culture.</p>
